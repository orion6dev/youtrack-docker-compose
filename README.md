# How to use

Clone this repository or download the zip.

```
git clone https://github.com/Egregors/youtrack-docker-compose.git
```

## Configuration

### Create and Configure YouTrack-specific Directories

They must be accessible to the user account that is used to run YouTrack service inside the container. 
YouTrack uses the non-root account 13001:13001 (group:id, respectively).
```
mkdir -p /srv/letsencrypt && mkdir -p -m 750 /srv/youtrack/{data,conf,backups,logs} && chown -R 13001:13001 /srv/youtrack
```

### SSL

HTTPs entry point is enabled by default thanks to [traefik](https://traefik.io/). 
All you need is just set your domain name and email variables in `env.example` 
and rename env.example` to `.env`

Don't push `.env` file in public repositories!

```
VIRTUAL_HOST=youtrack.example.com

LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=username@example.com
```

## Building and setup

Next, build the images: `make build`

or

```
docker-compose build --pull
```

All working folders will be mapped to `/opt/youtrack/*` on a host.

Now you can Up the service and continue settings in Web Interface: `make up`

or 

```
mkdir -p /opt/traefik && touch /opt/traefik/acme.json && chmod 600 /opt/traefik/acme.json
docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f -t --tail=10
```

**Note: First start can take a long time. Check logs to be sure everything ok:**

After initialisation Web Interface will be available on `https://yourdockerhost/`

Note: your SSL certs will be saved in /srv/letsencrypt folder.
